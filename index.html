            <h2 id="what-is-hawaghar">What is Hawaghar?</h2>
            <p>HawaGhar is a workshop targeted at anyone who wants a very well-rounded approach to learning things. It is 'massively multi-disciplinary', meaning we cover topics that would seem very disparate at first glance. It all ties together well, you learn an array of tools and approaches, but towards a single theme, which is 'art, technology, and the city'.</p>
<p>The workshop will begin on August 8, 2017, and last for 3 weeks. We will meet for three hours every day, but the meeting time can go down (or up) depending on student schedules and interest.</p>
<p>We believe that having had civic-minded, all-encompassing workshop that taught us how the city worked would have helped us connect better with Kathmandu, its institutions, and led to a lot less frustration. We are organizing the workshop to address those concerns — things that we wish we had known, that would have made living and working in Nepal easier and smooth.</p>
<p>Over the three weeks, the workshop will cover aspects of art (poetry, prose), creative technology (using algorithms to write poetry and generate art), event organization and entrepreneurship, civic activism, and civic technology. Our multi-disciplinary workshop is intended as a supplement to higher education — while colleges produce experts in narrow field, we want to encourage people to explore fields (art, leadership, technology, civic activism) tangential to what they studied. Our hope is that the workshop will help people in their quest to becoming able, stress-free and confident citizens, who are very comfortable with the machinations of the government.</p>

                <h2 id="details"> Detailed Weekly Description</h2>
                <p>
                    <h3>Week 1</h3>
                </p>
                <p>The first week of the workshop will cover both art &amp; technology. Participants will write and workshop poems and short pieces of prose for the first few days. It give them a better insight
                    into the writings and mindset of their fellow attendees. Attendees will learn creative programming in JavaScript language, to generate art, and poetry. The teaching of two separate approaches: art and technology, will be
                    quite complementary. Humans are lot more creative than the most advanced algorithms, but they can still leverage technology to generate interesting pieces of art. The first week of workshop will help students
                    get more comfortable for the following weeks, and also make them technologically sounder for what is to come.</p>
                <p>The final outcome of the first week will be a software program and written portfolio for each individual or group, which will be displayed for all to see in the website. The participants will already have something concrete to show on
                    the first week of the workshop.<br /> </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Week 2</h3>
                </p>
                <p>The second week of the workshop will cover entrepreneurship and event organization. We have invited various young self-made entrepreneurs to share their experience on how they started their businesses, and the attendees will able to pitch
                    in their ideas. We also have entrepreneurs whose projects were not successful at all, and they will share their experience with failing projects, and how to cope with failure. As an entrepreneur of any kind, it is essential not only
                    to prepare for failure, but to expect and embrace it. This approach will help attendees understand all dimensions of entrepreneurship and give them a better idea of the risks associated with it.</p>
                <p>However, we will spend most of the time in second week giving attendees a framework to come up with a business plan, and discussing it with other teams. We will then help them figure out what exact steps they would need to turn their ideas
                    into actions.&Acirc;&nbsp; To make sure they understand the harsh reality of every-day coordination, we will partner them with an organization, and make them volunteer with them. However, it will be set up such that the interests of
                    the organizations, and their assigned tasks will not be exactly aligned: it will be up to them to bridge the chasm between their interests, and those of their partner organizations. This will help explain
                    conflict-management, and the importance of good communication, in a business environment, better.</p>
                <p>If the workshop is large enough (with more than 20 participants), there will also be a 'entrepreneurial grand prize', which will fund the best project idea (based on votes and reviews of other participants) with Rs. 70, 000, on partial
                    equity of the final product.</p>
                <p>As a final project for the second week, the attendees will co-ordinate, and organize an event, that will need the use of the skills learned during the week. The event will be an 'art-exhibition' of sorts, where they will present their
                    creations from the previous week. The attendees will be guided, and provided the resources, but all facets of organization, including logistics, communication and marketing, will be tested on their part.</p>
                <p>
                    <h3>Week 3</h3>
                </p>
                <p>The third week of workshop will involve students using the knowledge learned over the first two weeks of workshop for civic-technology related tasks. First, the attendees will learn to edit open maps of Kathmandu online, and then use their
                    local knowledge of places around their residencies to update those maps. This will not only help during emergency and rescue operations in the future, it will also improve life for businesses and consumers. They will also learn to
                    edit Wikipedia, along with the related research methods, and the ethics of making honest edits. They will then add to Wikipedia topics on local places, events or personalities, after researching on it.</p>
                <p>The final week will also update students on pieces of civic technology, such as issue-reporting apps and government-access services, and train them to use those and teach other citizens to use them. Attendees will be trained on ways to
                    interact, and coordinate with bureaucratic structures, particularly governmental ones. Attendees will be assigned 'homework' of frequently going to their ward offices and getting some public work (such as pothole-filling, trash clearing)
                    done. This will teach them the value of patience, and give them a deeper understanding of working with governmental institutions.</p>
                <p>The final project for the third week will be a 'mapping and wiki-editing party' where the attendees will coordinate a 'party' by inviting friends and families, to collect data from their surroundings, and input it into online systems.
                    The workshop will cover all the expenses.</p>
